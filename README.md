About me
With years of experience as a lead screenwriter in the film and television industry, I have honed my ability to work under strict deadlines, collaborate within diverse teams, and break down complex narratives into clear, structured content. Now transitioning into the IT field, I bring with me a passion for problem-solving, attention to detail, and a deep curiosity about how things workâ€”especially the technologies that often seem like "magic" to the outside world. Eager to build a solid foundation in IT, I have already obtained certifications in AI fundamentals from Microsoft (AI-900) and IBM

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Codecademy's "Data and programming fundations for AI"
- âš¡ Fun fact: My hobby is a stand-up comedy (At some point I was one of the authors in biggest comedy production)
